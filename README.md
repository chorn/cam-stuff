## Low latency is the thing

I've had simple and crappy versions of this stuff forever, but they've always been really annoying.

Here's the problem I've been trying to solve:

- I have dogs and invisible fence.
- I hear the dogs barking outside.
- If there's a delivery truck or something like that, I need to run outside in a hurry if we want to get the delivery.
- Most webcam apps that come with the camera, or web-based services have a "long" delay.
- How do I optimize using whatever cameras I have?
- How do I optimize for the lowest latency?
